arXiv radar shows a map of today's arXiv papers where
similar papers appear near each-other.

It's a surprisingly handy tool to find the latest
papers for your taste. I use it everyday to discover
my favorite papers among ~200 others in 10 minutes.

This shows the UMAP of embeddings of arXiv data from our
[daily-arxiv-embeddings](https://github.com/orxaicom/daily-arxiv-embeddings)
repo.

This is hosted on front page of our website
[orxai.com](https://www.orxai.com).

Note: There are no new papers on arXiv on Saturdays and Sundays and
[Holidays](https://info.arxiv.org/help/availability.html).
